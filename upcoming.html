          <p class="title">Introduction to modern complex dynamics</p>
          <p class="abstract">
            In this presentation, I will give an introduction to complex dynamics. I will start with some historical reminders in dimension 1, presenting a few tools that lie at the heart of modern techniques, such as potential theory and ergodic theory. Then, I will explain the questions that interest researchers in modern dynamics, in dimension 1 or higher, and if time permits, I will try to make a connection with famous problems that do not directly involve dynamics but for which recent progress has been made using complex dynamics methods.

          <p class="title">Introduction to modern complex dynamics II</p>
          <p class="abstract">
            This presentation will be a continuation of the one initiated last week. This time, I will focus on the case of higher dimension. We will see that the concepts introduced last week in the one-dimensional setting can be extended to higher dimensions. The main difference between dimension one and higher dimensions is essentially the emergence of a new concept: the notion of positive currents. This concept generalizes the notion of functions or measures, which are predominant in dimension one. Currents are formally differential forms, but with non-smooth coefficients, they serve as a bridge between geometry and analysis, and are particularly well-suited for addressing problems in dynamics. I will also present some new results I have recently obtained on the dynamics of endomorphisms of projective spaces.

		  <p class="title">An introduction to the p-adic Riemann-Hilbert correspondence</p>
          <p class="abstract">
            The classical Riemann-Hilbert correspondence describes the relationship between local systems and flat connections on a projective smooth variety. In my talk, I will talk about its variant in the p-adic setting: I will elaborate all known results on p-adic Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, based on the works of Scholze, Liu-Zhu, Gao-Min-Wang and others.

          <p class="title">Recent breakthroughs on completing general period mappings</p>
          <p class="abstract">
            Since Griffiths' question in the 70's, it is a long-standing problem to find a completion of general period mapping with significant geometric and Hodge-theoretic meaning. The classical theories on the compactification of locally symmetric varieties by Satake—Baily—Borel and Mumford et al provide such completions to a very limited set of "classical" cases, while the problem has been almost completely open for non-classical cases until recent years. I will report the latest progress in this direction including several of my papers. Collaborators include Chongyao Chen (IMFP Shanghai), Colleen Robles (Duke), Jacob Tsimerman (Toronto).
